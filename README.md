=========

Map Areas (SECA, Int. Nav. Conditions Areas, War Risk, Piracy, etc.) polygons.

There are currently three area groups:

1. International Navigating Conditions - Areas
2. Sulphur Emission Control Areas
3. War Risk - Piracy

Each group of arreas is contained in one CSV file with four fields:

1. NARATIVE (the name of the area)
2. ORD      (the order of the point)
3. LATITUDE
4. LONGITUDE

If these polygons get drawn on a google map is should look like below image:
